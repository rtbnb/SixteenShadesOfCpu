Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk100mhz_in, sys_clk_pin.

TIMING-23#1 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between main_i/mmio_0/U0/dout[0]_INST_0_i_6/I0 and main_i/mmio_0/U0/dout[0]_INST_0_i_6/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#2 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between main_i/mmu_0/gram_mem_ck_INST_0_i_1/I3 and main_i/mmu_0/gram_mem_ck_INST_0_i_1/O to disable the timing loop

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin main_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_main_clk_wiz_0_0, clkfbout_main_clk_wiz_0_0_1

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin main_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk100mhz_main_clk_wiz_0_0, clk100mhz_main_clk_wiz_0_0_1

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin main_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk200mhz_main_clk_wiz_0_0, clk200mhz_main_clk_wiz_0_0_1
